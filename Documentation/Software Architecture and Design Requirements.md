Software Architecture and Design Coursework Key Requirements

The key requirements for this system are:
•	To obtain and display constant information regarding a company’s latest share price. The information must focus on the price of a share between two specified dates: today’s date and a maximum of two years ago from today.
  We will plan to use Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, and Bloomberg Terminal as sources of data.

•	To store the current share price every 30-60 seconds so that the application can function and give information to the user without a network connection. 
  This will be done by storing the most recent share price into a relational database.

•	To plot all of a share’s prices on a graph to display the value of a share throughout the year and its progression.

•	To display shares from another company and be able to display both company’s shares on the same graph if the user chooses.
